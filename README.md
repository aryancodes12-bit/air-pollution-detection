# Air Pollution Detection Dashboard

## Overview

Air Pollution Detection Dashboard is a web-based solution for monitoring air pollution through an integrated approach combining satellite observations, ground-based sensors, and historical reanalysis datasets. The platform is designed to provide near real-time visualizations of air quality metrics, supporting data-driven decisions and enabling future predictive modeling capabilities.
